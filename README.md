Learning Git and Github

Hey Everyone
Today I just started learning Git and Github and as a begineer I started watching Anuj Bhaiya Video from his Youtube Channel
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaeKhfhYE0U&t=1465s) and tried to immitate what he did. This is just a repository that i created after 
following the particular video and pushed it on my Github as well.
